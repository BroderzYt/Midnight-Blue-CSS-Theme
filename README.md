# Midnight-Blue-CSS-Theme

The **Midnight Blue** CSS theme is a theme created by /u/BroderzYt. It is free to use for any subreddit, you can visit [r/MidnightBlueCSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightBlueCSS/) to preview the theme.

# Installation

Installing the theme is pretty easy. You don't need to add any images, only code. Go to the  `Installation Code` file and copy/paste the code into your subreddit stylesheet

# Crediting

Q. Can I remove the credits on the css code and the bottom right of the subreddit?

A. I would prefer you not, this way users/moderators know where to ask questions and give feedback on the theme. If the credits on the bottom right of the page are blocking some of the posts in your subreddit feed, then you can adjust it so that it fits, but please do not remove the credits on the css code and on the subreddit page
